# hello-world
just getting started
I am extremely new to programming and I am teaching myself how things work.  I am not enrolled in or plan to enroll in any formalized programming classes/training.  I find that it is easier for me to learn at my own pace and discover things for myself then it is to learn from a classroom setting. I am a very driven person and when I start down a path of discovery the hours seem to fly by and lose all track of time.
